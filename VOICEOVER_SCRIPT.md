## 🎬 SCENE 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

### Narration:

"Welcome to the **Cyber Security Evaluator** - an **automated framework** for testing AI agent security.

[PAUSE]

This leaderboard shows **three agents** tested against **249 real-world attacks**, including prompt injection, jailbreak attempts, and system prompt extraction.

[PAUSE]

Let's see how they performed."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 2: Leaderboard Overview (0:30 - 0:55)

### Narration:

"The leaderboard ranks agents from **A-plus** to **F** based on their security posture.

[PAUSE]

Each agent is scored on how well it defends against **malicious payloads** while correctly handling **benign requests**.

[PAUSE]

Zero false positives means **no legitimate requests** are blocked."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 3: SOCBench Agent - Perfect Score (0:55 - 1:30)

### Narration:

"At the top is the **SOCBench code generation agent** with a **perfect 100 score**.

[PAUSE]

It successfully defended against **all 249 attacks**, including **207 system prompt extraction attempts** and **12 jailbreak attacks**.

[PAUSE]

With **zero vulnerabilities** and **100% accuracy**, it earns an **A-plus grade**.

[PAUSE]

This agent shows what robust security looks like."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 4: Home Automation Agent - Moderate Security (1:30 - 2:05)

### Narration:

"The **home automation agent** scored **71.69**, showing **moderate security**.

[PAUSE]

It successfully blocked **156 attacks**, but was vulnerable to **62 exploits** including system prompt extractions and SQL injection attempts.

[PAUSE]

With a **C-minus grade**, this agent needs **security improvements** before production deployment."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 5: Law Purple Agent - Critical Failure (2:05 - 2:40)

### Narration:

"The **law purple agent** scored **zero** - a **critical security failure**.

[PAUSE]

**Every single attack succeeded**. All **219 malicious payloads** bypassed its defenses, exposing **critical system information** and allowing **complete jailbreak access**.

[PAUSE]

This agent received an **F grade** and should **not be deployed** until major security fixes are implemented."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 6: MITRE ATT&CK Coverage (2:40 - 3:10)

### Narration:

"Each agent is tested against the **MITRE ATT&CK** and **ATLAS frameworks** - industry-standard security taxonomies.

[PAUSE]

We test for **prompt injection**, **jailbreak attempts**, **system prompt extraction**, and **SQL injection** across **multiple attack vectors**.

[PAUSE]

This ensures comprehensive security coverage for real-world threats."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 7: Vulnerability Deep Dive (3:10 - 3:40)

### Narration:

"The vulnerability reports provide **detailed analysis** of every security issue.

[PAUSE]

Each vulnerability includes the **MITRE technique ID**, **CVSS severity score**, **CWE classification**, and the **exact attack payload** that succeeded.

[PAUSE]

This level of detail helps developers **understand and fix** specific security weaknesses."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 8: GitHub Actions Integration (3:40 - 4:10)

### Narration:

"Testing is **fully automated** through **GitHub Actions**.

[PAUSE]

Simply submit your agent configuration, and within **minutes** you'll see **comprehensive results** including vulnerability reports, MITRE technique coverage, and detailed analysis of every attack attempt.

[PAUSE]

No manual testing required - everything runs automatically in the cloud."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 9: How to Submit Your Agent (4:10 - 4:40)

### Narration:

"Want to test **your AI agent**? It's **free, automated, and takes 5 minutes**.

[PAUSE]

Submit your agent through the **AgentBeats platform**, configure your API endpoint, and let the framework do the rest.

[PAUSE]

You'll get a **detailed security report**, a **leaderboard ranking**, and **actionable recommendations** to improve your agent's security."

---

## 🎬 SCENE 10: Call to Action (4:40 - 5:00)

### Narration:

"Visit **AgentBeats dot dev** to get started today.

[PAUSE]

Test your agent against **industry-standard security frameworks** and join the growing community of secure AI developers.

[PAUSE]

**Secure AI for everyone** - created by **Team ChAI GPT**: Archana, Jaya, Raj, and Subbu."

- [ ] Speak at **75% of normal speed** (clearer for video)
- [ ] Emphasize **bolded words** slightly
- [ ] Pause at `[PAUSE]` markers for **1-2 seconds**
- [ ] Record multiple takes of each section

### After Recording:
- [ ] Listen to each section

## 🎙️ Pro Tips

1. **Smile While Speaking:** Makes your voice sound more friendly and engaging
2. **Stand Up:** Better breath support and vocal projection
3. **Use a Pop Filter:** Reduces "p" and "b" sounds (or speak slightly off-axis from mic)
4. **Room Echo?** Record in a closet or under a blanket fort for better acoustics
5. **Breath Sounds:** Edit these out later, or turn slightly away from mic when breathing
6. **Energy Level:** Keep consistent energy throughout - re-record if you sound tired
7. **Time Check:** Record yourself reading one section and time it - adjust pace as needed

## 🎬 Good Luck!

Remember: **Don't aim for perfection on the first take.** Professional voice actors record multiple takes. Pick the best parts from each and combine them during editing!
