## 🎤 Audio Recording Tips

### Voice Settings
- Volume: Speak at 70-80% of normal volume (prevents clipping)
- Pace: Slightly slower than conversation
- Clarity: Enunciate technical terms
- Energy: Maintain enthusiasm throughout

### Record Separately
1. Record video first (with temp audio or silent)
2. Record voiceover while watching video
3. Sync in editing software
4. Easier to fix mistakes this way
